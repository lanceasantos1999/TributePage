          The Lakers avenged their 2008 Finals defeat by knocking off the
          Celtics in seven games. Bryant won his second consecutive Finals MVP
          award by averaging a series-high 28.6 points, 8 rebounds and 3.9
          assists. L.A. pulled out a tight Game 7 victory.

            <span class="bold">(1996) Drafted and traded - </span> With the 13th
            pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected Kobe
            Bryant, the teenage phenom from Lower Merion High School in
            Philadelphia. He’d earned four state championships in four years,
            but his stint with the Hornets wouldn’t last nearly as long. They
            traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vlade Divac. At age 17,
            Bryant was still considered a minor. His parents had to cosign his
            three-year, $3.5 million rookie contract.

            <span class="bold">(1997) Slam Dunk Contest Champion - </span>
            Bryant was 18 by the time All-Star Weekend rolled around. He didn’t
            make the team, but he did participate in the Rookie Challenge, and
            he won the Slam Dunk Contest. Bryant barely made it out of the
            contest’s opening round. He only scored a 37, slightly higher than
            Ray Allen’s 35. But he clinched the title in the second round with a
            near-perfect score. Bryant had 49. Chris Carr had 45. Michael Finley
            managed 33.

              >(1999 - 2002) Phil Jackson arrives and the three-peat -
            </span>
            The Lakers had been a playoff team with Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal,
            but they hadn’t quite reached championship form. The furthest they’d
            made it was to the conference finals. That all changed when Phil
            Jackson arrived. Jackson had already won six league titles with the
            Chicago Bulls. He’d twice won three in a row. Bryant and Shaq helped
            him accomplish it a third time. The Lakers knocked off the Indiana
            Pacers in 2000, Philadelphia 76ers in 2001 and the New Jersey Nets
            in 2002 for the NBA crown. To this day, this was the last time a
            team won three straight titles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">(2004) Fallout with Shaq - </span>Bryant and
            O’Neal had butted heads since they first teamed up in 1996. Shaq
            took issue with the style of basketball Bryant played, labeling him
            “selfish” and a “show off.” Bryant didn’t like the way O’Neal
            conditioned himself for the season and disproved of his antics when
            he wanted a higher salary. They held it together during their
            championship runs, but the cracks showed more than ever when they
            fell short against the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. That
            summer, the Lakers declined to retain Jackson as head coach. O’Neal
            demanded a trade and was sent to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom,
            Caron Butler and Brian Grant. The very next day, Bryant re-signed
            with the Lakers for seven years and $136 million.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">(2005) Phil Jackson returns - </span>The Lakers
            hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson as head coach. He signed a
            five-year deal, but he wouldn’t stay in the role long. He made it
            through 41 games before resigning due to poor health. Frank Hamblen
            took over as interim in 2005, but only made it through the remaining
            39 games. The Lakers missed the playoffs with a 34-48 record. Then,
            the Lakers turned to a familiar face: Phil Jackson. Bryant and
            Jackson’s second tenure ran more smoothly than the first. In
            December of that year, Bryant scored an astonishing 62 points in the
            first three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks. At the start of
            the final quarter, the Mavs only had 61 points. As impressive as
            that scoring outburst was, Bryant outdid it just a month later.

          <li>
            <span class="bold">(2006) Career-high 81 points - </span>On Jan. 22,
            2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto
            Raptors. It’s the second-highest points total in a single game in
            league history. Wilt Chamberlain set the record with 100 points in
            1962. Bryant shot 26-of-46 from the field, including draining seven
            from beyond the arch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">(2008) Olympian - </span> The United States Men’s
            Basketball team suffered a humiliating finish in the 2004 Summer
            Olympics in Athens, Greece. Despite being the overwhelming favorites
            to win the gold medal, the squad only earned the bronze. That
            changed when Bryant joined the squad ahead of the 2008 Summer games
            in Beijing. In eight games, Bryant averaged 15 points. He erupted
            for 13 points in the final quarter of the gold-medal game against
            Spain, which the Americans won 118-107.

              >(2008 - 2010) Return to championship form -
            </span>
            Bryant was already a three-time champion, but he had never won one
            without Shaq. O’Neal had gone on to win another title in Miami. And
            the supporting cast Bryant had played with since O’Neal’s departure
            was never nearly as talented. But when the Lakers traded for Pau
            Gasol in February 2008, Bryant’s fortunes changed for the better.
            The Lakers went on to finish 57-25 and advanced all the way to the
            NBA Finals. In the end, the Boston Celtics won the series, 3-2. But
            it was the last time anyone would best Bryant in the finals. The
            next year, the Lakers knocked off the Orlando Magic for their 15th
            title, Bryant’s fourth. And in 2010, the Lakers outlasted the
            Celtics to win Game 7, 83-79. It was Bryant’s fifth and final
            championship ring.

          <li>
            <span class="bold">(2012) Final Olympic medal - </span> Bryant
            donned the red, white and blue for the final time in 2012. He won
            his final gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. At 33,
            he was an aging star. But he still saw minutes in all eight games
            and helped the Americans run the table again. This time, he averaged
            12.1 points per contest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">(2016) ‘Dear Basketball’/Retirement - </span
            >Bryant spent the rest of his career chasing a sixth NBA title,
            which would have tied him with Michael Jordan. But injuries plagued
            him his final few seasons. On Nov. 29, 2015, Bryant published a poem
            in The Players Tribune, titled “Dear Basketball.” In it, he
            announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season. On
            April 13, 2016, Bryant played in his final NBA game. But it wasn’t a
            declining star’s melancholy limp across the finish line. Bryant came
            to play. He scored a season-high 60 points in the Lakers’ 101-96 win
            over the Utah Jazz.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">(2017) Jersey retirement - </span>On Dec. 18,
            2017, the Lakers retired Bryant’s jersey numbers. He’d worn No. 8
            until 2006, when he changed to No. 24. He’d first worn 24 in high
            school before changing to 33.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">(2018) Oscar - </span>In April 2017, Bryant made
            an animated short film out of his “Dear Basketball” poem. The
            following March, he added another trophy to his collection. “Dear
            Basketball” won the Oscar for Best Animated short Film at the 90th
            Academy Awards. The film also took home a Sports Emmy and the Annie
            Award that year.
